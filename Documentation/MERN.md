## **M**ongo **E**xpress **R**eact **N**ode

- The **MERN** stack consists of the following technologies:

  - **MongoDB** : A document-based open source database.
  - **Express** : A web application framework for Node.js.
  - **React** : A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.
  - **Node.js** : JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).

  ### **BONUS**

  - **Mongoose**: Simple, schema-based solution to model application data.
    - Connects backend to MongoDB.

## **Mongo DB**

> Easy to learn, free to use database

- Looks a lot like JSON, because its BSON (Binary JSON)
- Documents (Rows) can be nested inside each other.
- Sub-Documents allows us to apply concept of:
  - Data that is accessed together is stored together
- Arrays of data can be stored.

#### [**MongoDB Atlas**](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- Free to use Database.
- This is the Infrastructure Build tool.
- It builds the Database.

#### [**MongoDB Compass**](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

- GUI for MongoDB Atlas.
- This is a database tool that helps access MongoDB Atlas.
- [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass), install and start using.
- Makes working with MongoDB (Local and Remote) a lot easier.

##### _Main Difference between MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Compass_

- MongoDB Atlas hosts the Database.
- MongoDB Compass displays the Database in a much more readable way, its just a GUI.

### [**Steps**](./steps%20to%20build%20cluster.md) to build a **MongoDB Cluster**

- A cluster is a shared server with multiple databases
- Basically a group of Databases

## **Express**

> Makes Node.js easy to use.

## **React**

> Makes frontend components that can be reused.

## **Node JS**

> Easy to learn backend language.
